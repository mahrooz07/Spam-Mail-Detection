<H1>Spam Mail Detection with Logistic Regression.<H1>
<p>This project demonstrates how to build a spam mail detection model using machine learning. The model is built using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of how I implemented this project</p>
<H2>1. Importing Necessary Libraries</H2>

<H2>3. Handling Missing Values</H2>
<p>To handle any missing values in the dataset, I replaced them with NaN using pandas.notnull() function.</p>

<H2>4. Label Encoding</H2>
<p>I encoded the labels by replacing 'spam' with 0 and 'ham' with 1.</p>

<H2>5. Separating Data and Labels</H2>
<p>I separated the data (messages) and labels (categories).</p>

<H2>6. Splitting the Data</H2>
<p>I split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.</p>

<H2>7. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer</H2>
<p>I used TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.</p>

<H2>8. Converting Labels to Integer</H2>
<p>I converted the labels to integer type for compatibility with the logistic regression model.</p>

<H2>9. Training the Model</H2>
<p>I trained a logistic regression model on the training data.</p>

<H2>10. Evaluating the Model</H2>
<p>I evaluated the model's performance on both training and testing data using accuracy score.</p>

<H2>11. Making Predictions</H2>
<p>I built a predictive model to classify new emails as spam or not spam.</p>
<p><strong>Note : Give whatever mail you want to check whether it is spam or ham</strong></p>

<H1>12. Visualizing Data</H1>
<p>I printed the data at various stages to understand the transformations.</p>

<H2>13. Interpreting the Prediction</H2>
<p>Finally, I interpreted the prediction result and printed whether the mail is spam or not.</p>

<H1>Summary.</H1>
<p>In this project, I successfully built a spam mail detection model using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and achieved good accuracy in predicting whether a mail is spam or not. The project demonstrates the complete process from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.
